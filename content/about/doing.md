## What am I doing now?

I recently stumbled upon 2 separate philosophies that I am writing a book on. The complementary parts of Stoicism and Taoism for everyday life. It's in the research phase right now, but I'm going to be keeping this website updated with information on its status. You can see the details [here]({{< ref "projects/your-nature" >}}). It is going to be the culmination of all my self-work in the last year or two, and probably the next year, so that I can share what I've learned with the world.

On top of the Philosophy book I am currently researching, I am chasing after a fitness goal. I am exercising regularly because I want to reach 220 lbs of muscle by age 27. I've always found myself captivated by the level of dedication and effort involved in building muscle to such a degree, and I definitely want to do so myself to see what it's like. Not to mention, it gives me a reason to _really_ push myself when I am in the gym beyond just "general health".
