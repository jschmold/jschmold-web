#### Hi, I'm Jonathan!

At 24, I've been coding for the last 10 years of my life. As a kid, I really wanted to develop video games, and you couldn't shut me up about them (particularly Halo). Getting more into Shooters as I was growing up, and being totally in love with them back in Grade 6, I had to know more about them. Starting with the Yo Yo Games GameMaker, I made _very_ simple drag and drop games. I learned to mod Halo on the PC, hack (singleplayer) games using CheatEngine, build computers, you name it. I was insatiable, and I wanted more.

Eventually I got into a game called Combat Arms, which was absolutely _rampant_ with hackers. I wanted to know how to do that too, and so started my adventure into learning the absolute basics of C++. C++ was rather difficult to get anything "usable" in a short amount of time, and I eventually found out about C#. This was around the time I was playing a game called Garry's Mod. I played this game in high school for pretty well all of my free time. Once I made my first tool for a community there, using C# and Windows Forms, I was absolutely hooked the moment someone gave me a feature suggestion. It mean't someone was using my program!

After that point, you couldn't keep me away. I learned how to mod Garry's Mod, manage forums, mod forum themes, the list goes on. Python, Lua, Javascript, C#, Objective-C, C, F#, etc. I worked for a computer store in Grande Prairie, Alberta called AlbertaComputers.com, where I did sales, tech work, and went through _a lot_ of tech. This was where I picked up skills in Mac OS, Windows Server, Linux, game development, Photoshop, technical repair (software), and building computers.

In the last 5 years, I decided to double down and study Full Stack Development. First with React, ASP.Net, then with NodeJS and Angular. I specialized very heavily on full-stack web development, knowing that the Web touches _almost every single industry_ in the world. Being a Web Developer, you get to see _any_ industry in the world through the lens of a programmer solving a problem.
