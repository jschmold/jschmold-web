## How can I contact you

#### Aspiring Programmers

If you are someone who is learning programming, whether that be in University or just on your own, the best thing you can do is add me on Discord (Rachael#3022). I have helped a lot of up-and-coming programmers these past few years, and it is really important to me that the path to becoming a programmer is demystified and accessible to people who have the will. I won't be able to tutor you, but I will be able to point you in the direction you are interested in. Whether that be application, web, hardware, driver, or game programming, I have done my research for how to get into all of it. If you need help, and you're hungry to give it a shot, reach out. I will point you where you need to go, give you project ideas, and help you get started.
