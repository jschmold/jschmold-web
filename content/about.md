#### Hi, I'm Jonathan!

At 24, I've been coding for the last 10 years of my life. As a kid, I really wanted to develop video games, and you couldn't shut me up about them (particularly Halo). Getting more into Shooters as I was growing up, and being totally in love with them back in Grade 6, I had to know more about them. Starting with the Yo Yo Games [GameMaker](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker), I made _very_ simple drag and drop games. I learned to mod Halo on the PC, hack (singleplayer) games using CheatEngine, build computers, you name it. I was insatiable, and I wanted more.

Eventually I got into a game called Combat Arms, which was absolutely _rampant_ with hackers. I wanted to know how to do that too, and so started my adventure into learning the absolute basics of C++. C++ was rather difficult to get anything "usable" in a short amount of time, and I eventually found out about C#. This was around the time I was playing a game called [Garry's Mod](https://store.steampowered.com/app/4000/Garrys_Mod/). I played this game in high school for pretty well all of my free time. Once I made my first tool for a community there, using C# and [Windows Forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Forms), I was absolutely hooked the moment someone gave me a feature suggestion. It mean't someone was using my program!

After that point, you couldn't keep me away. I learned how to mod Garry's Mod, manage forums, mod forum themes, the list goes on. Python, Lua, Javascript, C#, Objective-C, C, F#, etc. I worked for a computer store in Grande Prairie, Alberta called AlbertaComputers.com, where I did sales, tech work, and went through _a lot_ of tech. This was where I picked up skills in Mac OS, Windows Server, Linux, game development, Photoshop, technical repair (software), and building computers.

In the last 5 years, I decided to double down and study Full Stack Development. First with React, ASP.Net, then with NodeJS and Angular. I specialized very heavily on full-stack web development, knowing that the Web touches _almost every single industry_ in the world. Being a Web Developer, you get to see _any_ industry in the world through the lens of a programmer solving a problem.

#### What am I doing now?
I recently stumbled upon 2 separate philosophies that I am writing a book on. The complementary parts of Stoicism and Taoism for everyday life. It's in the research phase right now, but I'm going to be keeping this website updated with information on its status.

#### How can I contact you

The best way to get a hold of me is via my [email](mailto:me@jonathanschmold.ca) or one of my social media handles. Facebook Messenger is by far the _easiest_ way to get a hold of me.
