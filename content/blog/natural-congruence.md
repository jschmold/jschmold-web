### Ideas
 - You know what rejuvenates you
 - Sacrificing what you love for what is seemingly "important"
 - The feeling of flow when you honor your internal nature and interests
 - Passage of time as you enter _the zone_ 

## Intro

I've had a bit of a difficult life, and have experienced existential crises on a fairly regular basis since I was 12. Why are things hard? Why does everyone else seem so happy? What does it mean to connect with someone? How do you know who you are? How do you know what you're here to do? These are all questions I've pondered for a very long time, and I get the sense I've finally stumbled upon my personal truth.

Stoicism, Taoism, First Nations spirituality, Buddhism, and many other belief systems all touch on the concept of one's nature. Stoicism talks about being "natural", where natural is to be moral, to be understanding, to build your spirit. Taoism talks about _The Way_, where it speaks about an inner peace that comes by going with the natural flow of life. For First Nations it's literally nature and the world around you that is rejoiced, that you want to bring yourself closer to being as one with. For Buddhism, you release your stranglehold on the world because the world will do as it will, and your function in life is to reach a state of Nirvana by striving to become more genuinely kind, compassionate, and helpful to the world around you.

Many old and new philosophies all have a guiding force that talks about "the nature" of something. I want to talk about an individual's true nature, how to rejuvenate yourself, and how to honor that nature by allowing your life's inertia to guide you to where you need to be.

# Knowing You for You

Every day is an opportunity to find yourself anew. Every day is a breath of fresh air that is meant to teach you how to be more like your nature. Identifying who you are is important, since that's the flag pole by which you guide your everything. I am the type of individual that likes to systematize everything, and to break it down into comprehensible chunks so I can reuse that information for other things. As such, I found it particularly helpful to categorize life into 5 pieces.

 - Health
 - Love
 - Fun
 - Knowledge and Wisdom
 - Mission

 ### Health
 
Health is the foundation of you as a biological being. Finding what is healthy for _your_ body and your mind means exploring. Does a certain food make you feel bad? Does a certain person remind you of a dark part of your mind? Do you feel insecure? Or worse, do you hate yourself?

You can measure your level of health quite easily, but maintaining a good quality of health is a commitment. Physical health involves finding the foods that energize you, exercising to strengthen your body, and moving around to keep your body flowing. For me this means eating a wide variety of foods, going to the gym every second day, and using techniques like Pomodoro to get myself moving around _even though_ I live a sedentary lifestyle.

Measuring your mental health is a little trickier depending on your energy levels, but it's straightforward if you're honest with yourself. How often do you hear things that make you push back, and bury uncomfortable thoughts? How often do you face your fears head-on? What is your relationship with yourself? Do you love yourself, and do you respect who you are as an individual? Do you know what it means to look at yourself in the mirror and have patience with your shortcomings or failures? Learning to get a grip on these elements of your psychological health will help make other parts of life easier, and the deeper your understanding of how your brain works, the easier it is to identify your own nature in terms of your health.

### Love

Love is active, understanding, and involving. You love your family, your kids, your siblings, your parents, your pets. Learning how you love means you can learn how to show love. Part of your nature is identifying what it means to love, for you as a person. Do you love people by taking care of their emotions, giving them kind words, giving them a hug, or helping them achieve something? Think about everyone you appreciate in your life, and ask yourself how you express love towards each and every one of them. How do you express your gratitude for someone when they help you?

How you love the world, the people around you, and yourself all comes from what your true nature is. In my case, the word Love is difficult for me to say because of past traumas. Instead I show it by studying how they respond to favors, to gifts, to compliments, and to encouragement. I show it by asking about their dreams, and helping them go for it. I encourage people, I share things I've learned, and I go to parties that I am uncomfortable at simply because they asked me to go (which I then help them clean up after). It is in my nature to be interested in showing those around me that while I am here with them, I am interested in helping them move forward.

### Fun

Fun is a way you can engage with the world to bring goodness to it. The things _you_ find fun are unique to you, and chances are, you aren't even aware of half of everything that you find fun. What things can you engage with that make you feel alright? Do you hike, write, or read? Do you party, do archery, or camp? What things do you participate in that bring a smile to your face?

Fun is a social creature thing. We are social, we like having fun, and we usually want to involve others. It's our way of engaging with the world, and bringing entertainment to ourselves. It doesn't have to have a purpose, it doesn't have to have rules, and it doesn't have to _be_ anything in particular. What are the things you find yourself having fun with?


### Knowledge and Wisdom

Knowledge, and what you've taken to learning are all little hints about your nature. Why did you like reading that book? Why did you take that course in school? Why did you get lost in listening to that documentary, that TV show, or that person's story? Why did you choose to know the things you know? After all, you held onto it this long and you can recall it. It must've had some importance to you, or spoke to some part of yourself. Knowing more about things that you are drawn to, no matter what they are, is a self-respect you afford yourself. It's a sign you are investing in who you are, and what you can do for the world. So, what do you know, and why do you know it? What drew you to it?

Wisdom is taking your experiences and translating them into something useful. What you took out of the things in your life tells you about your nature. Wisdom is a kind of knowledge, but it's specific to experience and the world. Wisdom is that ingrained understanding of how the world works around you based on how you've interacted with it throughout your life. The million little things you've picked up that add onto your wisdom also tell you about your perception, which is an element of your nature.
