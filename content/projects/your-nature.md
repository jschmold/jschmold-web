# Background

I've been looking for a way to find myself, and figure out what life is supposed to be all about. I've looked everywhere for answers, only to find that things just don't add up. Ancient texts are cryptic, a lot of current texts are bogus, and religion just doesn't do it for me. I wanted to understand what life was supposed to be like, and I wanted to understand what happiness _really_ is. How do you find that?


# Topics

In this book, I will discuss a loaded topic: finding and living consistently with your true nature. I will draw from Stoicism, Taoism, and other philosophical sources to elaborate on how you find, how you live in tune with, and how you commit to your true nature as a human being. Everyone's nature, drive, interests, and loves are unique to them as an individual; I discuss how to tap into these to live a more meaningful, in-tune life.
