# Background

For years, I wanted to have a personal website that spoke to who I am, as well as had a blog. Work got a little intense, and I never got around to actually making it.

Finally in 2020, I got around to building my personal website (the one you're on now) from the ground up using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), with a design I whipped off using Figma. This website will act as my digital resume, and my blog for things I learn as I proceed through life.
