# Background

Inspired by some work I was doing while at Communo, I decided that I wanted to take a crack at an Image Cropping tool in case I ever needed it again in the future. In the process, I learned that the Canvas can be used for quite a lot of image manipulation, and will definitely be leaning on it in the future should the need arise.
